\title{Get vaccine uptake multiplier from overall vaccine coverage fractions}
\usage{
getVaccineUptakeMultiplierFromCoverage(
  ages,
  population = flumodelsutil::flumodelsutil_data$population.US \%>\% dplyr::filter(YEAR
    == year & MONTH == 1 & AGE != 999) \%>\% dplyr::select(AGE, TOT_POP),
  year = 2015,
  originalCoverage,
  originalCoverageAges
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ages}{Vector of ages. Each element represents the upper range of an age range. The lowest bound is presumed to be zero.
If the oldest age does not reach the end of the population range, an additional element is added to span the full range.
The final age bracket cannot start after the final bracket of originalContactMatrixAges.}

\item{population}{Population data frame that contains age and population values. Defaults to 2015 US population.
The two required columns of the data frame are AGE and TOT_POP}

\item{year}{Year to sample population from. Defaults to 2015.}

\item{originalCoverage}{Original coverage fraction of vaccine, by age group.}

\item{originalCoverageAges}{Ages associated with originalCoverage Must be in same format as ages.}
}
\value{
Vector of vaccine uptake multipliers.
}
\description{
Calculates vaccine uptake multipliers suitable for use in flumodels::SEIRVModel. It takes
   vaccine coverage by age group (e.g., 65% for <18, 15% for 19-60, and 55% for 61+) and converts that into
   relative uptakes for arbitrary age bins.
